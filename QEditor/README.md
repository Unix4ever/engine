First Implementation
====================

This is the forst try to implement the editor.
It was abandoned, because:

1. It supports only OpenGL rendering. Writing WYSIWYG editor for
   D3D/Metal/Vulkan or anything else won't be possible.
2. Kind of rendering used there is pretty unstable and does no longer
   work on recent QT versions.

Don't struggle to compile this editor. It's code is very outdated and no
longer supported. It is kept here in case if I need to make another try
of using QML5 for editor (hopefully I won't).
