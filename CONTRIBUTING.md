Though task backlog is in pivotal tracker, feel free to add issues to github.

If that's not a question, I will just copy the ticket in pivotal tracker.

Contributing
============


Fork the repo on GitHub
1. Clone the project to your own machine
2. Commit changes to your own branch
3. Push your work back up to your fork
4. Submit a Pull request with a single commit preferably

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

Commit messages
===============

Describe WHAT you've done in the first line of the commit and add ticket
number if any.
Describe WHY this change was made in the description.

No commits with messages like `asdf` or `fix` would be accepted.
