Introduction
============

This tutorial will teach you how to create some basic scene using Gsage engine.

If you have not built the engine yet, check out these build tutorials:

| :ref:`conan-build`
|

After you build the engine you will have the following file structure:

* :code:`GsageExe`/:code:`GsageExe.app`/:code:`GsageExe.exe` executable file should be
  in the **build/bin** folder. This file is the main game executable.

* All resources are located in **./resources** folder. This folder is symlinked to **GsageExe.app/Contents/Resources**
  on the Mac OS X systems.

* :code:`GsageEditor`/:code:`GsageEditor.app`/:code:`GsageEditor.exe` should also be in the game folder.

By running :code:`GsageExe` executable, you can start the simple isometric RPG example.

Editor is not very usefull at the moment, however it can show some realtime scene state.

Modifying Level
---------------

If you open **resources/levels** folder, you will find named **exampleLevel.json** there.
This file provides some basic level example, you can change it in any way.

You can try to:

1. Add some model to **resources/models** folder (:code:`world.mesh`).
2. Change entities list, and add this model to position :code:`"x: 0, y: 0, z:0"`:

.. code-block:: javascript

  entities: [
  ...
  {
    "id": "hello",
    "render": {
      "root": {
        "position": "0,0,0",
        "rotation": "1,0,-1,0",
        "scale": "1,1,1",
        "children": [{
          "type": "model",
          "mesh": "world.mesh",
          "castShadows": true
        }]
      }
    }
  }
  ...


If you run **GsageExe**, you should see your model on the scene.
MovementSystem should automatically calculate walkable areas for this mesh.

For more information about entities format see :ref:`entity-format-label`.

Creating Characters
-------------------

If you open **resources/characters** folder, you will see couple entities defined there:

* **sinbad.json** which is controlled by player.
* **ninja.json** which are hostile NPC.

You can use these characters as a reference and create a new character:

1. Grab model with some animations and add it to models folder.
2. Create new :code:`json` file in the **resources/characters** folder.
3. Now you should be able to configure the character:

   3.1. Write Render Component

   .. code-block:: javascript

      "render":
      {
        "resources":
        {
          "Mob":
          [
            "Zip:models/packs/mob.zip" // pack file
            // or you can do
            "FileSystem:models/mob/"
            // or you can omit this section and add resource folder in global settings
          ]
        },
        "root":
        {
          "scale":"1,1,1",
          "rotation":"1,0,1,0",
          "children":
          [
            {
              "type": "model",
              // this is important, otherwise this entity will be treated as part of level
              "query": "dynamic",
              "name": "modelName",
              "mesh": "mob.mesh",
              "castShadows": true
            }
          ]
        },
        "animations":
        {
          "states":
          {
            // animation is configured as <model_name>.<animation_name>
            "walk": {"body": "modelName.WalkAnimation"},
            "idle": {"body": "modelName.IdleAnimation"},
            "attack": {"top": "modelName.AttackAnimation"},
          },
          "defaultState": "idle",
          // animation speed. Adjust if necessary
          "defaultSpeed": 1
        }
      }

   3.2. Write Movement Component

   .. code-block:: javascript

      "movement":
      {
        // movement speed
        "speed": 10,
        // animation to use for movement
        "moveAnimation": "walk",
        // animation/speed ratio to apply
        "animSpeedRatio": 0.15
      },


   3.3. Write Stats Component

   .. code-block:: javascript

      // stats component is not limited by param types at all
      "stats": {
        "anything": 123
      }

   3.4. Write Script Component

   Create script file **characters/scripts/mob.lua**.
   This file will be used as a setup script.

   Startup script should return a function that accepts one parameter.
   This way the function will get subject entity as the first parameter.

   .. code-block:: lua

      -- log information on startup
      return function(self) print("I am alive! (" .. self.id .. ")") end

   Then write behaviour:

   .. code-block:: lua

      local function moveRandomly(self, context)
        local position = Vector3:new(
          self:render().position.x + math.random(30) - 15,
          0,
          self:render().position.z + math.random(30) - 15
        )
        self:movement():go(position)
      end

      local function createTree()
        return Repeat(
            Delay(Leaf(moveRandomly), function() return math.random(700)/100 + 3 end)
          )
        )
      end

      btree.register("walker", createTree)

   Saving it as **behaviours/trees/walker.lua**.

   Then you will be able to define script component:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      "script":
      {
         "setupScript": "@File:characters/scripts/mob.lua",
         "behavior": "walker"
      }

4. Add character to scene. Edit **scripts/start.lua** file, add:

   .. code-block:: lua

      entity.create("mob")

   This will create NPC.
   Or you can use lua console in GsageExe.

   Console can be invoked by :code:`F9` key.
   Type the same line there, and NPC will appear.

Modifying UI
------------

UI integration is managed by classes, derived from :cpp:class:`Gsage::UIManager` interface.
Engine can have several UI libraries running at the same time.

LibRocket
^^^^^^^^^

:code:`RocketUI` plugIn should be installed.

LibRocket looks like a dead project, but it can be configured
very nicely using rml and rcss files.

And also it supports lua bindings out of the box, so can have very organic
connection with other parts of the engine.

All librocket ui files are stored in the :code:`resources/ui` folder.
Currently it's in the mess, but it will be cleaned up very soon.

Imgui
^^^^^

:code:`ImGUI` plugIn should be installed.

Imgui views can be registered in lua using:

   .. code-block:: lua

      -- render method
      function render()
      imgui.ShowTestDialog()
      end

      -- render view class for stateful UI
      View = class(function()
      end)

      function view:__call()
      imgui.ShowTestDialog()
      end

      local view = View()

      imgui.render:addView("viewID", view)
      imgui.render:addView("viewID2", render)

      -- remove
      success = imgui.render:removeView("viewID")
